The Texas Hold 'Em Advisor will display information on your hand strength, pot and outs equity, and eventually some simulations to help you analyze your hold 'em hand. 

You can use it here:
https://heyimmatt.github.io/texas_holdem_advisor/

Enter pot and call amounts to see the pot equity percentage.

Click or tap the Add Card 1 and 2 buttons to add your dealt cards and then click Evaluate Hand to receive pre-flop advice.

Click New Hand at the bottom to reset the page.

Additional functionality to be added to show outs equity percentage based on the flop, turn, and river cards.
